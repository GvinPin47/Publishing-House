This repository is designed for the needs of the publishing house. For each writer at home, the initial development branch is initialized.

Rules for decorating the branches and confirming the works:

	1. Each work should be in its catholic. For example: "Books / Alexandrov.A.A / Rudiments of Reason.v.0.0.1.doc"
	2. All illustrations for works should be stored in the same directory as the work itself.
	3. After the publication of the work in the repository, it is necessary to contact the editor of the publishing house and inform about 		the intention of publishing his work in the master line.
	4. Expect the editor's decision on the work.
